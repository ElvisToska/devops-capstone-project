As a developer,  
I need to enhance the account microservice with REST APIs to read, update, delete, and list customer accounts,  
So that other microservices can interact with customer data in a reliable and standardized way.

### Details and Assumptions
- The database model and the "create customer account" endpoint are already implemented.
- Development will be done in a Python Flask-based framework.
- The system must handle basic CRUD operations for customer accounts.
- The environment includes access to the online lab setup for development.

### Acceptance Criteria
  ```gherkin
  Given the database model exists and the "create" endpoint is functional
  When I add the "read customer account" endpoint
  Then other microservices can fetch customer data by providing a valid customer ID

  Given the database model exists and the "create" endpoint is functional
  When I add the "update customer account" endpoint
  Then other microservices can update specific fields of a customer account by providing a valid payload

  Given the database model exists and the "create" endpoint is functional
  When I add the "delete customer account" endpoint
  Then other microservices can remove a customer record by providing a valid customer ID

  Given the database model exists and the "create" endpoint is functional
  When I add the "list customer accounts" endpoint
  Then other microservices can retrieve a paginated list of all customer accounts
